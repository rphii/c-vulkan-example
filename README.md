# c-vulkan-example

My goal for this project is to touch vulkan for the first time to better
understand the whole graphics pipeline and create real applications with it in
the future.

This code is mostly guided by [drawing a
triangle](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Setup/Base_code).

Futher chapters are not (yet) implemented.

**Dependencies**
- glfw
- vulkan
